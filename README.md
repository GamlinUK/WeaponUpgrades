# Weapon Upgrades
Welcome to Weapon Upgrades. This is a spigot 1.17 Minecraft plugin which allows players to upgrade their weapons though crafting. The Plugin is currently under early active development which Snapshot builds regularly releasing. The plugin is very light on functionality but we have plans on what to add in the coming months.

## What is 'Weapon Upgrades'?
Weapon upgrades is a plugin for PvP game modes where players collect various weapons, the idea is instead of cluttering your inventory with various weapons, you can use these to progress into higher tiers.

## Okay? What can I do?
Upgrade your weapons! Crafting recipes are pretty standard across the board. Use 4 of the same tier weapon (e.g. 4x Wooden sword) to get an upgrade version (e.g. 1x Stone sword).

## Couldn't this have easily be done in Skript?
Yes. It probably has - I just felt like updating an old project :)

I am toying with the idea of a Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/DmkvzOEh/weapon-upgrades), let me know what you think!

I haven't touched Minecraft plugin development in years and this is a revived project from [CraftBukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/upgrade-your-sword). Please be patient with me as I get on my feet with this.
